# Drupal CMS

Drupal CMS is a fast-moving open source product that enables site builders to easily create new Drupal sites and extend them with smart defaults, all using their browser.

## Getting started

### Lando instructions
Note: These instructions are not tested, they're just, educated guesses by Alison.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `lando start`
3. Install Drupal:
  1. To use the Starter site template:
  ```
  lando drush site:install --db-url=mysql://drupal11:drupal11@database/drupal11 -y
  ```
  2. To use the Byte site template, a big fancy site template (i.e. lots of features and content, like Umami):
  ```
  lando drush site:install recipes/byte --db-url=mysql://drupal11:drupal11@database/drupal11 -y
  ```
4. Go to your new site!

P.S. Byte didn't work for me must now, oh well.

📚 Note: The rest of this README is what came with the project.

<hr>

Drupal CMS has the same system requirements as Drupal core, so you can use your preferred setup to run it locally. [See the Drupal User Guide for more information](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/installation-chapter.html) on how to set up Drupal.

### Installation options

The Drupal CMS installer offers a list of features preconfigured with smart defaults. You will be able to customize whatever you choose, and add additional features, once you are logged in.

After the installer is complete, you will land on the dashboard.
